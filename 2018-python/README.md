# advent-of-code 2018: Python
My solutions for [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018) using Python.

## Requirements

Python 3

## Instructions

Each day's puzzle solution lives in a file named `dayX.py`, with its associated input in `inputX.txt`. A solution expects its input to be given on `stdin`, for example:

`$ cat input1.txt | python3 ./day1.py`

I'm using this as a chance to re-familiarize myself with Python, which I haven't used in many years.

Input format copied from [dainnilsson](https://github.com/dainnilsson/adventofcode-2017).
